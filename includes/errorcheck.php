     Either you can test the loading screen with my steamID. This will make sure that your loadings screen is configured correctly. <br>
	 But do note that <i>server name, server map</i> and <i>server gamemode</i> will not be shown as that is shown when the user is loading with javascript: <a href='$loadingurl?steamid=76561198051229287'>$loadingurl?steamid=76561198051229287</a><br><br>
	 
	 If you instead want to get the link to put in your server.cfg, then choose this link. The %s is the steamID of the connecting user and ?steamid is the function to fetch this steamID: <a href='$loadingurl?steamid=%s'>$loadingurl?steamid=%s</a><br><br>
